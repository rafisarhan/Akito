Purpose of this repository is to create a robot that can move in multiple different way; a robot that can walk with two legs like a human, walk with four legs like a spider, use wheels like a car (using two or four wheels), and jump like a frog or jump like a spider. This idea was inspired by this clip https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAV2umH-6ic ; this technology could be use in search and rescue operation and this could also let any robot be used to any type of terrain.
